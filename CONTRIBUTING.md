## Golang guidelines
- Keep it simple stupid (KISS)
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- Single responsibility principle (SRP)
- Use gofmt to format your code
- Use goimports to organize your imports
- Use go vet to check for errors
- Use go test to run your tests
- Use go mod to manage your dependencies
- Use go lint to lint your code
- DO NOT use `panic` unless it's a critical error
- DO NOT use `fmt.Println` for debugging, use `logger` in `worker` package instead
